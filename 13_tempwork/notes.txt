K13 -- Template for Success: the CSS gets worse. Helena's teammates cry.
2020-10-15

OUR NOTES:
  - We had two different interpretations of how to handle Python-to-HTML transfer:
    + Helena version: Create a str variable that holds a string of HTML code, return it with the template
    + Ishita version: Use jinja to transfer the HTML code into the template, so it all comes out with the template
  - Is there a difference? Which one is better?
  - We (read: Helena) made almost everything a marquee, except the job selection, because it has that chaotic energy
  - We investigated the <audio> tag, and are currently working to blast "I'm In Love With An E-Girl"
  at all times on our website
  - We found that you can return multiple things by concatenating them in return
