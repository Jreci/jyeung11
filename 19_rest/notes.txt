"import urllib.request as urllib2"

-Making a simple HTTP request using the key yields a JSON object containing info such as date, explanation, and img urls.
-We inported urllib.request instead of urllib2 due to error messages stating that urllib2 module does not exist.
-data["url"] refers to the img url
-data["explanation"] refers to the description explaining what the img is showing
-We read the API key in .txt file as a String with file = open('key_nasa.txt','r') and key = file.open()
In app.py, we concatenated "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=" and the API key, which was then used as the 
input for .urlopen().
-Using jinja, we inserted info from the JSON object that was read by app.py into index.html
